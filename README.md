# EducationDAO

## Vision
EducationDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed to support open-source educational resources. By leveraging blockchain technology, EducationDAO enables a transparent and democratic process where members can propose and vote on initiatives that advance open education for all.

## Smart Contract
### Contract Address
`<INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE>`  
Deployed on the Ethereum network, this contract governs the proposal, voting, and execution processes within the EducationDAO.

### Functions
- **addMember(address member)**: Add a new member to the DAO. Only the owner can call this function.
- **removeMember(address member)**: Remove an existing member from the DAO. Only the owner can call this function.
